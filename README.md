This is the best I can do with the default Microsoft theming engine, if you don't like something, it is likely because of those limitations.
This is built upon their High Contrast theme, so be aware that some programs might look different. If you don't like it just select the Windows default theme and everything will be reverted.

Personal recommendations and fixes:

   Firefox:   
        First go to Preferences -> Color and Appearance -> Colors -> In the drop down menu, select "Never".
        Install DarkReader to make websites dark, also install ShadowFox to Theme Firefox Dark on every page!

   Chrome:
        Install this theme.
        Make all websites Dark with Dark Reader extension (set a hotkey to toggle on/off for sites).
        To change styles of your most visited sites use the Stylus extension. Here is a list of good dark themes, for popular sites.
        I use this extension to make the scroll bars dark.

   Visual Studio fix:
        Visual Studio will switch to the High Contrast theme and remove syntax highlighting. Fortunately this can be fixed, I created a small guide here.

   f.lux:
        This program reduces the color temperature of you monitor at night, blue/white light can cause headaches, stress and bad sleep.
        Download f.lux and set it to a value comfortable to you, I personally use 3200K.
        It might look strange to you at first, but try using it for 10 minutes at night, then turn it off to see how uncomfortable it is without.
