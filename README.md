# GreyEveTheme - Windows 10 High Contrast Theme
A Dark Grey Windows 10 Theme


This theme can be used *without* system modifications. Just download and double click the theme file.

This is the best I can do with the default Microsoft theming engine, if you don't like something, it is likely because of those limitations (white borders).
This is built upon their High Contrast theme, so be aware that some programs might look different. If you don't like it just select the Windows default theme and everything will be reverted.

**Personal recommendations and fixes:**

  **Firefox**:   
        
 - In firefox - Preferences -> Color and Appearance -> Colors -> In the drop down menu, select "Never".     
 - Install [Shadowfox](https://github.com/overdodactyl/ShadowFox)        
 - Install [Dark Background and Light Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-background-light-text/) (best performing dark extension from my testing)
Set your settings like [this](https://i.imgur.com/l4vuqir.png)
 - If you would like to set better themes you most visited websites, you can do this with [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), get your themes at [UserStyles](https://userstyles.org/)

 **Chrome**:
       
 - Install a dark theme

 **Visual Studio fix**:
        
 - Visual Studio will switch to the High Contrast theme and remove syntax highlighting. Fortunately this can be fixed, created a small guide [here](http://pastebin.com/pyUTD9CQ).


If you find know of any other application fixes, please open an issue, I might add it.
